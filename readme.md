Secreto is a web application developed during leisure time to explore and comprehend various concepts. It utilizes technologies like jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and PeerJS to facilitate video/audio calls and chatting functionalities, resembling those found in social applications.

## Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to serve as a learning resource and starting point for individuals seeking to delve into web development. Often, students tend to showcase basic projects like library management or product galleries in the guise of e-commerce websites. Secreto aims to break this trend by offering a simple yet feature-rich platform that allows for exploration and skill enhancement.

## Features

Peer-to-Peer Connectivity: Utilizes PeerJS to generate unique secret codes for establishing connections between users.
Code Sharing: Users can share their secret codes with desired participants to initiate connections.
Connection Establishment: Participants can enter shared codes to connect with each other seamlessly.
Chat Functionality: Enables users to engage in text-based communication once connected.
Video/Audio Calls: Facilitates real-time video/audio calls between connected participants.

## Contribution Opportunities
