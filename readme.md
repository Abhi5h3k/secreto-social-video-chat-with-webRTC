## Purpose

The primary aim of this project is to serve as a learning resource and starting point for individuals seeking to delve into web development. Often, students tend to showcase traditional projects like library management with basic CRUD operations or product galleries in the guise of e-commerce websites. Secreto aims to break this trend by offering a simple yet feature-rich platform that allows for exploration and skill enhancement.

## Features

- Peer-to-Peer Connectivity: Utilizes PeerJS to generate unique secret codes for establishing connections between users.
- Code Sharing: Users can share their secret codes with desired participants to initiate connections.
- Connection Establishment: Participants can enter shared codes to connect with each other seamlessly.
- Chat Functionality: Enables users to engage in text-based communication once connected.
- Video/Audio Calls: Facilitates real-time video/audio calls between connected participants.

## Contribution Opportunities

- UI Enhancement: Design and implement a visually appealing user interface to enhance user experience.
